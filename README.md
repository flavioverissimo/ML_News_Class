# Financial News Topic Modeling

### Prerequisites:

You need Anaconda and VS Code or Sublime Text installed on your machine.

## Description:

The development of the financial news classification model was developed with the aim of returning which class represents a given news item. By collecting news from the internet and inputting it into the model after training, the model will return which category the news belongs to.

The data was collected from the [BBC](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html), it is real data where the news was labeled in the categories that fit.

The objective of this model is to be restricted to only the categories on which it was trained, any news inserted that deals with random topics can return results that are unrealistic.
