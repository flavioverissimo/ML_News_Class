# Financial News Topic Modeling

### Prerequisites:

You need Anaconda and VS Code or Sublime Text installed on your machine.

## Description:

The development of the financial news classification model was developed with the aim of identifying other news that is obtained on the internet from the model and then knowing which class it represents.

The data was collected from the [BBC](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html), it is real data where the news was labeled in the categories that fit.

The objective of this model is to be restricted to only the categories on which it was trained, any news inserted that deals with random topics can return results that are unrealistic.
